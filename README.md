A magical UML diagram editor which instantaneously generates code in the Concerto Schema Language.

Concerto is a lightweight, 100% Javascript schema language and runtime, developed by The Accord Project. It works in both a NodeJS process or in the browser. To learn more about the concerto language, refer to the [official documentation.](https://docs.accordproject.org/docs/model-concerto.html)


### How to use the editor ?
#### UML class diagram to Concerto Code
- Drag and drop class diagrams from the palette to the drawing area
- Each metamodel node has a class name, metamodel type and properties which can be edited by a single click on them on the diagram
- The metamodel nodes can also be linked to each other to depict relationships. Hover towards the bottom of a node and click to activate linking and point it towards a child node.
- Code is generated instantaneously on the Monaco Editor to the left.

#### Concerto Code to UML class diagram [WIP]
- Write code on the Monaco code editor
- Click the update button
